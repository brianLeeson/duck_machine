"""
A bit field is a range of binary digits within an
unsigned integer. Bit 0 is the low-order bit,
with value 1 = 2^0. Bit 31 is the high-order bit,
with value 2^31. 

A bitfield object is an aid to encoding and decoding 
instructions by packing and unpacking parts of the 
instruction in different fields within individual 
instruction words. 

Note that we are treating Python integers as if they 
were 32-bit unsigned integers.  They aren't ... Python 
actually uses a variable length signed integer
representation, but we ignore that because we are trying
to simulate a machine-level representation.

# Sign extension is a little bit wacky in Python, because Python

# with some differences that show up especially for negative
# numbers. I've written this sign extension function for you so
# that you don't have to spend time plotting a way to make it work.
# You'll probably want to convert it to a method in the BitField
# class.
#
# Examples:
#    Suppose we have a 3 bit field, and the field
#    value is 0b111 (7 decimal).  Since the high
#    bit is 1, we should interpret it as
#    -2^2 + 2^1  + 2^0, or -4 + 3 = -1
#
#    Suppose we hve the same value, decimal 7 or
#    0b0111, but now it's in a 4 bit field.  In that a
#    case we should interpret it as 2^2 + 2^1 + 2^0,
#    or 4 + 2 + 1 = 7, a positive number.
#
#    Sign extension distinguishes these cases by checking
#    the "sign bit", the highest bit in the field.
